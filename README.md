# RAGify - Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems

The purpose of this repository is thus to provide a comprehensive and dynamic hub to showcase the latest retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, and to enhance their error reduction as well as processing speed and contextual richness. It‚Äôs the go-to resource for those looking to become an RAG master ‚Äî an assembly of curated Jupyter notebooks for learning and teaching RAG concepts. If you‚Äôre trying your hand at retrieval-based approaches to improve AI models or are just a fungi out for some advanced RAG methods, this repository is your thing.

# Introduction 
The combination of generative AI and information retrieval using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a scientific and technological revolution. This repository features a hand-collated set of advanced techniques to greatly enhance your RAG system‚Äôs ability to provide more accurate, relevant, and overall system data.

You can find all the course notebooks in the notebooks directory. These notebooks cover various aspects of building and fine-tuning RAG models, providing both theoretical background and practical, hands-on examples.

We aim to create a useful resource for the research and practitioner community to take the RAG to the uttermost extreme. Together we hope to accelerate innovation in this fabulous area by fostering a collaborative environment.

# Key Features
üß† State of the art RAG enhancements.
üìö Each technique has it‚Äôs own documentation.
üõ†Ô∏è Practical implementation guidance.
üåü Latest advancements, regular updates.

# Running the Notebooks
You have two options for running the code in these notebooks:

<b>Run Locally:</b> You can clone the repository and run the notebooks on your local machine. To do this, ensure you have a Python installation with the necessary dependencies.

<b>Run on Google Colab:</b> Each notebook includes a link at the top to open it directly in Google Colab, making it easy to run without local setup.
